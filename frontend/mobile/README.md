# Veil Mobile

Expo (expo-router + TypeScript) mobile app for Veil. This is the bootable shell —
a single placeholder home route (`app/index.tsx`) proving the toolchain runs. No
wallet logic or SDK is wired up yet.

## Getting started

```bash
cd frontend/mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

Then press `i` for the iOS simulator, `a` for the Android emulator, or `w` for web.

## Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

`npm test` runs Jest through the `jest-expo` preset. Suites live next to the code
they cover, in `lib/__tests__/`.

## Encrypted backups

`/settings/backup` exports the wallet's non-secret state — address, signer public
keys, settings — as an AES-256-GCM envelope sealed with a user passphrase, then
hands the file to the system share sheet.

The envelope format is byte-compatible with `sdk/src/backup.ts`, so a file
exported on mobile restores in the web wallet and vice versa. Private key
material never enters a backup: `assertNoSecretMaterial` in `lib/backup.ts`
rejects the metadata before encryption if it finds a secret-looking field.

## Structure

- `app/_layout.tsx` — root Stack navigator (expo-router).
- `app/index.tsx` — placeholder home route.

Native `ios/` and `android/` folders are generated on demand (via prebuild/EAS) and
are gitignored, along with `node_modules/` and `.expo/`.
